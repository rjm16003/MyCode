How to play:
Run the program file. A menu will appear prompting for a number. If you wish to read the rules of the Bulls and Cows game, enter the number 2 to read the rules. 
If you wish to quit the menu, enter the number 0 to exit. Otherwise, if you wish to play the game, enter the number 1 into the menu.

A prompt will appear for the desired difficulty. If you wish to play on easy, enter the number 0. If you wish to play on medium difficult, enter the number 1. 
If you wish to play on hard, enter the number 2. A number other than the above will automatically set the difficulty to hard. 
The difficulty is directly related to the number of guesses allowed to the user.

The game will prompt to input a guess. The guess must be 4 digits with no numbers appearing more than once. 
If the input is invalid, a message will print out saying the input is invalid and you will be prompted to enter another guess. 
Once a valid guess is entered, the program then calculates the number of bulls and cows.

A bull signifies your guess correctly guessed a digit in the correct spot. A cow signifies one of the digits in your guess is in the wrong spot. 
After each guess, you are given the option to give up, restart, or continue. 
When you successfully guess all 4 positions, thus getting 4 cows, the game ends and a you win message is printed out. 
If you fail to guess the number in the turns allotted from the difficulty, then a game over message is printed.

Once the game ends, you have the option to view the history of your game with each guess and the results of that guess. 
After that is printed out, you have the option to exit the program or play the game again.
